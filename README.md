## Hi there 👋
My name is Marilena, welcome to my GitHub page! Here you can find the projects I'm working on as a M.Sc. student in [Electronics–Radioelectrology and Control & Computing](https://en.phys.uoa.gr/postgraduate_studies/interdepartmental_program/general_information) at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), with a B.Sc. in Physics, also from NKUA. 
My interests include AI, Embedded Systems, and Mathematics. I'm interested in applying AI and ML to practical challenges and turning ideas into real-world solutions.
