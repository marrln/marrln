## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my github page, here you can find the projects I'm working on as a M.Sc. student in [Electronics–Radioelectrology and Control & Computing at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://en.phys.uoa.gr/postgraduate_studies/interdepartmental_program/general_information), with a B.Sc. in Physics. 
My interests include AI, Embedded Systems, and Mathematics. I'm interested in applying AI and ML to practical challenges and turning ideas into real-world solutions.
